# File Transfer System project made by Aman Bawane;
i  have done this project in the span of a week;
was able to make backend with cpp ;
tried making some frontend too ;
i wanted to do this project further with more features(because of MTE i wasnt able give my whole time in it i tried my best to do it and this was my first time getting hand on DEV);


Sometimes it gives error while getting things with frontend;
i wasnt able able to figure it out now i will try it after MTE;
if such case occur you can directly compile the client.cpp and server.cpp on two different devices in the terminal it will work perfect for LISTing the files in server,UPLOAD a file in the server,DOWNLOAD a file from the server.
